{"name":"Gofem","tagline":"Go Finite Element Method","body":"### Welcome to Gofem, an implementation of the Finite Element Method in Go (golang).\r\nThis project includes a number of routines to develop the FEM for solid and porous media. Our targeted simulations include the static and dynamics of structures, multi-phase fluid flow through porous media, and the behaviour of porous media considering the coupling between liquid, gas and solids. Some sub-packages are created to make the FEM implementation easier; these include:\r\n\r\n* **shp**      shape structures and quadrature points\r\n* **inp**      input data structures. simulation, materials, meshes\r\n* **msolid**   models for solids\r\n* **mconduct** models for liquid/gas conductivity in porous media\r\n* **mreten**   models for liquid retention in porous media\r\n* **mporous**  models for porous media\r\n* **fem**      finite element method\r\n* **out**      results analyses and plotting\r\n\r\nGofem is developed in/for Debian systems at the moment. It depends on [Gosl that is available here](https://github.com/cpmech/gosl).
